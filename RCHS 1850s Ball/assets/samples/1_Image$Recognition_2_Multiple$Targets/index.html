     	Good evening. Welcome to the Hart House.
		We have dancing in our parlor, and oysters, roasted grouse and champagne in our dining room.
     	If there is anything that you need, I will be delighted to assist you.</div>
    <div id="bridget1" class="dialogue" title="About the Ball">
    	Our Balls start at 9 o'clock and usually last until 3 in the morning. 
    	To tell you the truth, Balls are not for me.
    </div>
    <div id="bridget2" class="dialogue" title="Irish Immigration">
    	I was born in Ireland and immigrated to Troy to escape the Potato Famine.
    	The Harts are one of the few families in Troy to employ Irish maids and Black coachmen.</div>
    <div id="bridget3" class="dialogue" title="Bridget's Work History">
    	Mrs. Hart is kind enough to pay me $1.00 a week, with free room and board. 
    	Mrs. Hart's mother, Mrs. Howard, sent me with her to keep her company and help her adjust to her life in Troy.  
    	I've cooked and cleaned for her and even helped her birth her children. </div>
    <div id="bridget4" class="dialogue" title="Servant Duties">
    	I have worked from dawn to dusk, helping the other two Irish maids cook, clean and 
   		attend to the 14 children. We have cleaned the gasolier gloves, moved the front parlor furniture to the back parlor 
    	and rolled up the carpets to make room for dancing.

	<!-- Parlor dialogues -->
    <div id="maria" class="dialogue mainquestion" title="Maria Tillman">
    Mr. Burden has drank himself into quite a fix. I've already told him I have saved 
    my last dance for Mr. Richard Hart. Mr. Burden is in no condition to dance with anyone, 
    including himself.</div>
    <div id="maria1" class="dialogue" title="Ask Mr. Hart to Dance">
    Heavens no! At the ball, the men must approach the women and ask for a couple's dance, 
    like the polka and the Waltz. It would be improper for me to ask Mr. Hart. Line dances, 
    however, are an exception. </div>
    <div id="maria2" class="dialogue" title="Couple's dance">
    A couple's dance is a close dance, with both partners arm in arm. The Waltz popularized 
    this type of dancing in my mother's time. However, the polka is more popular these days.  
    It uses a gliding chase step and turning hop, rather than the dizzying spins of the 
    Waltz.</div>

   <div id="billy" class="dialogue mainquestion" title="Billy Burden">
   Miss Tillman has refused any more offers to dance with me.  She says I have had one too 
   many smiles of punch because I fell during the Virginia Reel.</div>
   <div id="billy1" class="dialogue" title="Champagne">
   It can be served on ice, with punch, or even alone. Technically, champagne is the name 
   of sparkling wine from the Champagne region in France. The science of making sweet, 
   sparkling wine is better understood today as well, especially since the process of 
   riddling the sediment has been improved, making the drink more bubbly than it's 
   ever been!</div>
   <div id="billy2" class="dialogue" title="Champagne">
   Well, it's all the craze in Europe right now since glassmaking and mechanical corking 
   were perfected. You can find it advertised in all the magazines, newspapers, and 
   billboards. And, it's a perfectly respectable drink for ladies. Champagne is the 
   preferred drink of the rich and famous!</div>
   




	<!-- Virginia Reel dialogue opens after the music stops playing in the parlor -->
	<div id="virginiareel" class="dialogue mainquestion" title="Band Songs">
		The Harts hired a 9-piece band who set up at the end of the hallway. 
		They played this Virginia Reel and Polka songs for guests to dance in the parlor.
	</div>
	<div id="virginiareel1" class="dialogue mainquestion" title="The Virginia Reel">
		A folk dance that dates from the 17th century, with Scottish and English roots.
		Couples form two lines facing each other, with men on one side and women on the other.
		They meet as a couple at one end, and dance between and down the lines to the other end.
	</div>
	<div id="virginiareel2" class="dialogue mainquestion" title="The Virginia Reel">
		The band will play until the last guests leave, usually until 3 in the morning.
		Mrs. Hart does not stay up that late as she is 51 years old. In fact, she leaves
		the house by 11 o'clock and stays in another residence in Troy.

    	My parents were married in 1816. My mother, Betsey, has been suffering from the loss of my late father, Richard.
    	He died in this house in 1843 when a servant accidentally poured kerosene instead of water 
    	while he was smoking a cigar and taking a bath. Mr. Hart had served as Mayor of Troy from 1836 to 1838.
    </div>

    	Eight of my sisters, in fact, have attended the institution.
