	<!-- Bridget Larkins, hallway maid -->
     <div id="bridget-dialog1" class="dialogue mainquestion" title="Bridget Larkins">Good evening. My name is Bridget Larkins.  
     	If there is anything that you need, I would be delighted to assist you.</div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog2" class="dialogue">I am enjoying it very much. And you sir/madam?</div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog3" class="dialogue" title="Irish roots">I was born in Ireland and immigrated to Troy due to the Potato Famine.
    	The Harts were one of the first families in Troy to hire Irish and freemen as their servants.</div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog4" class="dialogue" title="Bridget's Work History">I have been with the Harts for as long as I can remember. 
    	They are a good family and very kind to me. Mrs. Hart's mother, Mrs. Howard, sent me with 
    	Mrs. Hart to keep her company and help her adjust to her life in Troy. I've been with Mrs. Hart for so many years that 
    	I've cooked for her, cleaned for her, watched her grow up and even helped her birth her children. </div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog5" class="dialogue" title="Maid Work Hours">I work from dawn to dusk, cooking for the family, cleaning and maintaining the home, and 
   		making sure the children are tended to. 
    	I am 56 years old and cannot work like I used to, but the Harts are still very good to me. 
    </div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog6" class="dialogue">Wonderful. You may join the other guests in the dining room. 
    	Please enjoy the refreshments and appetizers.</div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog7" class="dialogue">I do believe there are many interesting things to see around this house. 
    	We have desserts and dancing in our parlor. And we have desserts, hor d'ourvres and champagne
    	in our dining room.</div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog8" class="dialogue">Mrs. Hart has been suffering from the loss of her late husband Richard. 
    	Her mother, Mrs. Howard has moved in and I believe her presence has really been helping Mrs. Hart compose herself. 
    	I must say, I truly admire the initiative the Hart women have been taking towards education for young women. 
    	I never would have imagined little Betsey would ever grow to be so engaged in business and city culture. </div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog9" class="dialogue" title="Educating Women">Richard and Betsey both have had quite an interest in promoting education. 
    	Betsey strongly supported the Troy Female Seminary. Eight of her girls, in fact, have attended the institution.</div>
    <div id="bridget-dialog10" class="dialogue">She has changed so much since she first came here with Richard. 
    	I remember, when Betsey was young, she could hardly cook and was reluctant to mingle with the older wives in the 
    	neighborhood.
    </div>
    
    <!-- Catherine Nichols, dining room maid -->
    <div id="catherine-dialog1" class="dialogue mainquestion">
    	Good evening.  Mrs. Hart has the finest tastes in town. The oysters arrived from the city this morning, and the 
    	game was caught yesterday.</div>   
    <div id="catherine-dialog2" class="dialogue mainquestion">
    	If you are looking for ice cream or champagne, you can find them in the drawing room.</div>
    <div id="catherine-dialog3" class="dialogue mainquestion">
    	If there is anything you fancy, I am here to help.</div>
	<div id="catherine-dialog4" class="dialogue mainquestion">Mrs. Hart runs an impeccable household. 
		We moved the parlor furniture to the back building and rolled up the carpets to make room for the dancing.  
		The china had to be unpacked and cleaned.  I snore, we've been dusting and polishing all week!
